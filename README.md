Once you enter your first guess, the game begins. You will be shown how many letters are in the word, your correct guesses and your incorrect guesses. You are limited to 10 incorrect guesses per round. 

Guess the word before running out of guesses and you get a win. The "New Game" button will then select a new word to try for another win.
